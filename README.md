I use *{} to set a default style for the whole page, so there would be some issues with tag default style. But I styled them to make them look similiar with the given example. However, they are not exactly same with the example. I realized that I should set default style by body{}, but changing the whole style sheet requires huge amount of time... So, I just leave them there....
